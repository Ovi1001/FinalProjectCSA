Description:
My game is as simple as playing TicTacToe with a friend. Yes, you heard me, TicTacToe. Everyone knows how to play TicTacToe, but have you played it in a console environment? 

How to play: 
First, type in the name of player 1. Next, type in the name of player 2. To play, wait for your turn and when it is, type in the position of where you would like to go. For example, if player 1 wanted to go in the middle, they would type in "5" as this is the 5th square counting from top left to bottom right. The turn will then go to the next player. This will repeat until a winner is determined. If you want to play again, type in 0 In the event of a tie, the round will restart. 

Interesting Features:
1. There is a random move option. If someone wanted to spice up the game a little bit or couldn't decide where to go, they could choose the option of letting the program decide their fate. It will pick a random place to go on the board. 
2. My program actually checks for ties within the TicTacToe game. As simple as it may seem, it was hard to implement in the right location. It will automatically check for ties and will restart if one is ever found.
